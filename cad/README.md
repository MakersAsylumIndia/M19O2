This folder is dedicated to Oxikit CAD files and version-control. This is modelled as a submodule.

Submodule is currently in argo-1 repositories.

*Starting/Kickoff contents*
Oxikit_v22 - 
 * F3D file (Fusion 360), 
 * STEP file (converted from F3D),
 * STL file (converted from STEP. for light *3d viewing* only) 
 * FreeCAD document (converted from STEP file. No feature model)

*TODO CAD*
 * Convert F3D feature model appropriately to FreeCAD.
 * Set up framework for newer local design iterations and dimensional variants.
 * Integrate local subassembles/component information and product BoM management

*TODO General*
 * Create submodules under MakersAsylum git. Current submodules are linked to argo-1 repos. Argo-1, and others, can thereafter fork the submodules for their own development from MakersAsylum.
