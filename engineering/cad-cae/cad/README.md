*Starting/Kickoff contents*
Oxikit_v22 - 
 * F3D file (Fusion 360), 
 * STEP file (converted from F3D),
 * STL file (converted from STEP. for light *3d viewing* only) 
 * FreeCAD document (converted from STEP file. No feature model)

* All individual OxiKit parts (exported from Fusion) as STEP files.

 * Convert F3D feature model appropriately to FreeCAD. --> Make freecad assembly with step files.
 * Set up framework for newer local design iterations and dimensional variants.
 * Integrate local subassembles/component information and product BoM management
