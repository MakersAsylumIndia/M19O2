# M19_Oxikit_SD
Software development
Git submodule for M19 software development.
 
Submodule is currently in argo-1 repositories.

 *TODO General*
 * Create submodules under MakersAsylum git. Current submodules are linked to argo-1 repos. Argo-1, and others, can thereafter fork the submodules for their own development from MakersAsylum.
 * Add all software dev work here.
